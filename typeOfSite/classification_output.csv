"*** StoneWash *** Car Care Center , 818 Paris Rd , Mayfield , KY , 42066",36.7325312,-88.6330322,36.7325312,-88.6330322,STONEWASH CAR CARE CENTER,Corner,"The car wash property sits directly at the junction of two major through‐streets (Paris Road/Route 121 and Jones Street). In the zoom-level 18 image you can clearly see both streets meeting at an intersection. Zoom-levels 19 and 20 reveal drive‐in lanes and customer access points on both Paris Road (a multilane, signed route) and on Jones Street. Because it fronts and has vehicle entry on two intersecting main roads, it meets the definition of a Corner Lot."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,Corner,"The A-Key Car Wash is situated at the southwest quadrant of the intersection between Prince Street (US-209, a multi-lane arterial with marked turn lanes) and Ross Street (a two-lane road with center markings). In all zoom levels, you can clearly see two distinct curb cuts providing direct access from both streets, confirming that the lot fronts on two public roads that meet at a corner. The presence of wide travel lanes, painted turn arrows on Prince Street, and a visible intersection geometry meets the criteria for a Corner Lot."

"Abercorn , 10509 Abercorn St , Savannah , GA , 31419",31.9858522,-81.1330952,31.9856125,-81.1327189,LUV Car Wash,Corner,"At zoom levels 18–20 the car wash clearly sits at the junction of two major roads: Abercorn Street (a multi-lane state route) on its east side and West Magnolia Avenue on its north side. You can see wide lane markings, turn arrows, and direct driveway access onto both streets. The lot has frontage on each roadway, forming a distinct corner intersection rather than being mid-block, so it meets the criteria for a Corner Lot."
"Alabaster Wash and Wax , 916 1st St S , Alabaster , AL , 35007",33.2331449,-86.8116296,33.2331449,-86.81162959999999,Alabaster Car Wash,Inside,"All three zoom levels show the car wash sitting mid-block along the west side of a single major road (1st St S/US-31), with no intersecting major street immediately adjacent to the lot. The north, south, and west boundaries are either undeveloped forest or backyards, and the only access drive faces 1st St S. No second wide roadway meets at the corner of the property, so it does not form a corner lot."
"Alameda , 395 Alameda Blvd NW , Albuquerque , NM , 87114",35.1891491,-106.6161158,35.1891633,-106.616062,Champion Xpress Carwash,Corner,"At the broadest zoom (18) you can clearly see the car wash sits at the northeast corner of the intersection of Alameda Blvd NW (a multi-lane, signalized east–west thoroughfare) and a major north–south arterial. Both the south and west lot lines border these wide, marked roads, with dedicated turn lanes, crosswalks, and driveways onto each. The lot has vehicular access on both the south side (Alameda Blvd NW) and the west side (the intersecting street), satisfying the definition of a corner lot."
"Alamosa , 51 Craft Dr , Alamosa , CO , 81101",37.4765837,-105.8945442,37.4765318,-105.8944942,Champion Xpress Carwash,Corner,"The car wash sits directly at the junction of two major thoroughfares—Craft Drive on the east side and Hartman Way on the south side—forming a clear corner lot. Both roads are wide, carry through traffic (as evidenced by lane markings, turn arrows, and visible intersections), and provide direct access on two adjacent sides of the property. The lot’s building footprint and access drives are oriented to serve vehicles entering from both streets, confirming it is a corner location rather than a mid-block (inside) position."

At zoom 18 the intersection of these wide, signalized thoroughfares is evident; zooms 19 and 20 show driveways and lane markings on both streets providing access on two sides. This matches the Corner Lot criteria of being adjacent to an intersection of two main roads with accessible frontage on both."
"All American Car Wash , 917 N 7th St , Vincennes , IN , 47591",38.6808632,-87.5201897,38.6808632,-87.5201897,All American Car Wash and Express Lube,Inside,"All three zoom levels show the car wash building and its surrounding paved lot sitting mid-block on N 7th St between Harrison St (to the west) and College Ave (to the east). The lot has a single curb cut onto N 7th St and does not sit directly at an intersection of two major roads. Minor driveways or alleys behind the site do not connect two main streets. Therefore, by definition it is an Inside Lot with access only from one main road."
