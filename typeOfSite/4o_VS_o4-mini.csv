Both streets have sufficient width and connectivity to classify them as major roads, meeting the corner lot criteria.","At all zoom levels the car wash site only fronts one major thoroughfare (Paris Rd) and lies mid-block between the Paris Rd & Jones St intersection to the north and Paris Rd & Cleveland St to the south. The only other roads touching the lot (Jones St, Cleveland St and S 3rd St) are narrow local/residential streets, not major multi-lane roads. Because it does not occupy the corner of two primary roads but instead sits between minor cross-streets and faces only Paris Rd, it meets the definition of an Inside Lot."

Both roads are clearly main roads, as identified by lane markings and visible infrastructure for vehicle traffic flow. The lot occupies a corner geometry relative to these intersecting roads, satisfying the criteria for a corner lot classification.","At all zoom levels the car wash only directly fronts one high-volume arterial (Prince Street/State Route 209). The street on the opposite side (Ross Street) is a narrower local road, not a multi-lane highway or major cross-arterial. There is no intersection of two primary roads bounding the red-circled lot, so it does not occupy a true corner of two major thoroughfares."

The images depict the lot situated mid-block, between other properties, lacking characteristics of a corner lot location such as visibility to intersecting thoroughfares.","At the red-circled car wash site, only one major road (US 1) runs directly alongside the lot. The adjacent Gary Place is a two-lane local access road rather than a second multi-lane or named highway. There is no intersection of two major roads bounding the property; all other bordering drives are private or service entrances. Therefore, the car wash sits mid-block on a single main thoroughfare and qualifies as an Inside Lot."

Abercorn Street is a major multi-lane thoroughfare, and the lot's adjacency to the intersection of these roads classifies it as a Corner Lot.","The car wash sits directly at the intersection of two major roads – Abercorn Street (a four-lane state highway) on its east side and W Magnolia Avenue on its north side. Both streets are wide, clearly marked arterial roads with turn lanes and traffic controls.

The only other streets abutting the lot are residential/side streets (10th Ave SE, 11th Ave SE) with single-lane traffic and no turn lanes, signals, or highway shields. No two wide, primary roads form a corner around the red-circled parcel, so it meets the criteria of an Inside Lot rather than a Corner Lot."

The lot has curb cuts onto both of these major roads, and two of its sides face them, forming a visible corner rather than lying mid-block. Lane markings, turn arrows, and bus stops confirm both streets’ primary status, meeting the criteria for a corner lot."

The car wash has frontage on both streets, with visible turn lanes on Craft Drive and wide curb cuts on Hartman Way. Because it sits at the intersection of these two principal roads, it meets the definition of a corner lot."

The lot is visibly bordered by these two roads, forming a corner, and the surrounding context shows lane markings and moderate urban infrastructure, confirming its status as a Corner Lot.","The red-circled car wash lies directly at the junction of two major through-streets (College Avenue running north–south and Washington Avenue/N 7th Street running east–west). In all zoom levels you can see both wide roadways meeting adjacent to the lot, complete with turn lanes and crosswalk markings, and the building fronts on both streets. These are not small service drives or alleys but primary roads, so the site clearly occupies a true corner lot."

The lot is visibly adjacent to this intersection with prominent roads bordering at least two sides. Additionally, the presence of road markings, multiple lanes, and nearby commercial establishments confirm the roads' importance, supporting the classification as a Corner Lot.","All three zoom levels show the car wash lot sitting at the junction of two major roads (Morganza Road and Weavertown Road). At the broadest view (zoom 17) you can clearly see a multi-lane arterial (Morganza Rd) intersecting another wide, signed road (Weavertown Rd) immediately adjacent to the red-circled property. The mid-level zoom (18) shows curb cuts and driveways entering directly onto both roads, and multiple turn lanes and crosswalk markings at the intersection. The tightest zoom (19) confirms the lot faces both main streets at the corner of the ‘V’ they form — it is not mid-block nor simply bound by service drives. These features satisfy the Corner Lot criteria."

The neighboring areas are primarily parking lots and buildings, and the location is not situated at the corner of intersecting wide roads. Thus, it is classified as an Inside Lot.","The car wash sits along a single four-lane arterial and does not border a second major road at the red-circled lot. On one side it faces a high-capacity street (with multiple lanes and turn arrows), but the opposite edge abuts Beaver Meadow Trail, which is a narrow park/service path rather than a true public roadway of comparable importance. There is no intersection of two wide, signed roads directly adjacent to the lot. Thus, it is an inside lot—mid-block along one main road without forming a corner of two major thoroughfares."

Furthermore, no other major roads intersect at the edges of the lot marked in red circle, classifying it as an Inside Lot.","The car wash sits mid-block along Freeport Road with only one true major‐road frontage. The lane to the north/west is a private service/exit ramp for the adjacent freeway, not a second arterial street. There is no intersection of two wide public roads at the circled lot, so it meets the definition of an inside lot."

These roads appear to be major thoroughfares due to their width and surrounding commercial properties, confirming its classification as a Corner Lot.","Across all zoom levels, the car wash sits mid‐block on Scalp Avenue and only abuts one major road. The only other streets touching the red-circled parcel – Chrysler Avenue to the north and Constable Avenue to the south – are narrow residential streets, not major thoroughfares. There is no intersection of two wide, high-volume roads immediately adjacent to the lot, so it does not occupy a corner of two main roads. Thus it is an inside lot."

These are wide roads with lane markings and named road signs, confirming that the lot is situated at the corner where two major roads meet. Thus, the lot is classified as a Corner Lot due to its position and its access to two main roads.","At all zoom levels the lot fronts only one clear major road (E 8th Avenue) and backs onto a narrow service drive (William Marks Drive) alongside the railroad. There is no intersection of two wide, heavily marked public roads at the red-circled site. The side streets (Martha Street/William Marks Drive) are minor or private access ways. Thus the car wash does not occupy a corner of two major roads and should be classified as an Inside Lot."

Evidence from Zoom level 17 shows nearby traffic infrastructure consistent with major roads (e.g., Sheetz convenience store and other adjacent establishments). Moreover, Zoom level 18 and 19 images highlight the clear adjacency of the lot to the corner created by these intersecting roads. Therefore, this location qualifies as a Corner Lot based on its placement and proximity to intersecting major roads.","The red-circled parcel sits mid-block along New Salem Road (T-926) and does not directly occupy an intersection of two major highways. While U.S.-40 runs a short distance to the north, the lot itself only fronts New Salem Road. Its opposite boundary is Mall Run Road, a private/service drive rather than a second main thoroughfare. Because only one wide public road borders the site and it is not located at a true crossroad of two major streets, this qualifies as an Inside Lot."

This intersection is prominent due to its clear markings, road signage, and substantial traffic lanes visible in the satellite images. The red-circled lot directly interfaces with both roads, meeting the criteria for a corner lot.","Although the car wash sits adjacent to a highway ramp, it only fronts one true major road (E Felton Rd). On the other side it borders a private drive/ramp and a minor side street (Felton Pl), not a second major thoroughfare. There is no two-highway or two-main-road intersection directly at the red-circled lot and only a single curb cut onto E Felton Rd.

In the 17 level view the nearest cross-road (Terrell/’Rose’ Lane) is one property to the west and is only a narrow two-lane service street with no turn lanes or highway markings. In the 18 and 19 views the red-circled lot is flanked by other businesses (fuel station and furniture store) along a single main corridor, with only one side facing the highway and no cornered junction of two primary roads. This fits the definition of an Inside Lot."
"Big Dan's Woodstock , 289 Ridgewalk Pkwy , Woodstock , GA , 30188",34.1198494,-84.5205176,Big Dan's Car Wash,Inside,,Corner,1,Inside,"The car wash is situated at the intersection of Ridgewalk Parkway and another major road, Bethany Creek, with both roads exhibiting wide lanes and clear infrastructural indicators of being major roads. The red-circled lot is adjacent to the visible corner formed by these roads, fulfilling the criteria for a Corner Lot based on proximity to intersection and adjacency to main roads.","The car wash sits mid-block along Ridgewalk Parkway and does not front an intersection of two major roads. On its north side is Ridgewalk Pkwy (a main road), but the other sides abut an internal service drive and neighboring commercial lots rather than a second major street. There is no visible corner formed by two wide, labeled roads adjacent to the red-circled site, so it meets the criteria for an Inside Lot."

The location directly fronts both these roads on two sides, forming a visible corner. These roads are major and accommodate significant traffic, satisfying the criteria for a Corner Lot.","The circled car wash sits directly at the signalized junction of SR-92 (a multi-lane state highway with median turn lanes and highway shields) and Claremore Drive (a wide, through arterial). Two major roads meet adjacent to the lot, and the site has curb cuts and frontage on both. These characteristics—multiple lanes, turn lanes, crosswalks, highway designation, and dual frontages—confirm it is a Corner Lot."
"Big Kahuna CW , 61 Commodore St , Hazard , KY , 41701",37.299364,-83.2012171,Big Kahuna Car Wash,Inside,,Corner,1,Inside,"The car wash is located at the intersection of Commodore St and a service road parallel to the highway, which can be considered an important junction due to the proximity to major traffic routes. Two main roads are adjacent to the lot, satisfying the criteria for a corner lot.","At all zoom levels the Big Kahuna car wash only fronts Commodore Street – a two-lane local access road – and is not located at the junction of two primary thoroughfares. The nearby four-lane Highway 80 runs parallel above the site with no direct curb cut or ramp intersection at the car wash. There is no second ‘main’ road intersecting the lot; it is situated mid-block between other commercial parcels along a single street, meeting the definition of an Inside Lot."
"Big Peach Forsyth , 126 N Lee St , Forsyth , GA , 31029",33.0404585,-83.9400952,Big Peach Car Wash - Forsyth,Inside,1,Inside,1,Inside,"Upon analyzing the provided satellite images across different zoom levels, the car wash marked within the red circle does not appear to be situated at the intersection of two major roads. It is instead located adjacent to a single road, surrounded by other properties as part of a shopping complex and does not exhibit characteristics of a corner lot. The adjacent major road (Route 42) does not directly form a corner intersection with any other major road near the property's boundaries.","At all zoom levels the red-circled car wash fronts only one major roadway (GA-42). Its western boundary abuts the private parking/service drive of the adjacent strip center rather than a second public arterial, and there is no intersection of two wide roads directly at the lot. Driveway cuts and curb access exist only on GA-42. Therefore this site sits mid-block along a single main road and qualifies as an Inside Lot."
"Big Peach Jackson , 583 E 3rd St , Jackson , GA , 30233",33.2947224,-83.9602247,Big Peach Car Wash,Inside,,Corner,1,Inside,"The car wash is located at the intersection of E 3rd Street and Park Avenue, which are both recognizable as major roads from width, lane markings, and signage in the images. This corner positioning satisfies the criteria for a Corner Lot as it is directly adjacent to an intersection of two primary streets.","At all zoom levels the Big Peach Car Wash sits mid-block along E 3rd St (a major east–west corridor) but is only bordered otherwise by Park Avenue, a two-lane local street, and a private/service drive for the adjacent hotel. There is no intersection of two wide, heavily marked or highway-designated roads directly at its red-circled lot. Only one side of the lot fronts a major road, so it meets the definition of an Inside Lot rather than a Corner Lot."
"Big Peach Ola , 3479 Hwy 81 , McDonough , GA , 30252",33.4366472,-84.0385491,Big Peach Car Wash,Inside,,Corner,1,Inside,"The red-circled lot is located at the intersection of Highway 81 and another major road clearly visible in the images. These roads are wide, feature lane markings, and demonstrate traffic importance. This places the car wash on a corner lot as it meets the criteria of being at the intersection of two major roads.","The red-circled lot sits mid-block along Hwy 81 with no second major road intersecting immediately at its boundary. The nearest intersection (leading north to Publix and the Shoppes) lies to the west of the lot, while to the east there is only a minor service drive and undeveloped land. Because the car wash fronts only a single main road (Hwy 81) and is not positioned at the junction of two major thoroughfares, it meets the criteria for an Inside Lot."
"Big River Selma , 2409 N Broad St , Selma , AL , 36701",32.4325392,-87.0249312,Big River Car Wash,Inside,,Corner,1,Inside,"The red-circled Big River Car Wash is located adjacent to Broad Street and Highland Avenue, two major roads that intersect nearby. The lot has frontage along Broad Street, a significant arterial road, which confirms its placement at a prominent location indicative of a corner lot. The provided satellite images also show clear signs of the property's proximity to main road intersections and accessibility, supporting this classification.","At all zoom levels the car wash sits mid-block on North Broad Street between Highland Avenue to the south and Dawson Avenue to the north. It only fronts one major roadway (Broad Street) and does not occupy the corner of Broad with Highland, Dawson, or any other arterial. The western boundary is a minor local street (Lauderdale), not a second major road, so this is an inside lot."
"Big River Troy , 1221 US-231 , Troy , AL , 36081",31.7801113,-85.949913,Big River Car Wash,Inside,1,Inside,1,Inside,"After analyzing the provided satellite images, the car wash marked by the red circle is located within a larger commercial plaza and does not sit at an intersection of two major roads. It is adjoining parking spaces and buildings to its immediate vicinity, with major roads visible but not adjacent on all sides. Therefore, it satisfies the criteria for an Inside Lot.","The car wash sits in the middle of a large shopping-center parking lot and only directly faces one main road (the highway running along the lot’s northern edge). There is no intersection of two wide, major roads at the red-circled parcel — the east/west service drives and adjacent private lanes are narrow and secondary. On all other sides the site is bounded by the parking field or minor access drives, not by a second major thoroughfare. Therefore, it does not occupy a street corner and is classified as an Inside Lot."

The images do not show the car wash situated at a corner formed by two major roads, and the surrounding area indicates that the property is an Inside Lot following the criteria provided.","All three zoom levels show the car wash fronting only on Blanding Boulevard (State Road 21), with no intersecting major street directly at its lot boundary. The lot is set mid‐block between adjacent commercial parcels. Nearby roadways at the rear and side of the lot are internal drive aisles, service drives, or private parking access—not wide, two‐way public roads or intersecting arterials. Because only a single main road borders the property and there is no corner intersection of two major roads, this is an Inside Lot."

The lot faces multiple wide roads, confirming its Corner Lot status.","The Blu Waye Express Wash lot is situated at the southwest corner of the signalized intersection between E Franklin St (US-82, a multi-lane highway with highway shields and turn lanes) and N Westberry St (a wide, marked city thoroughfare with crosswalks). The red circle abuts two major roads, has curb cuts on both frontages, and clearly occupies the corner of these two main streets, meeting all criteria for a Corner Lot."

This aligns it as an Inside Lot based on proximity and placement details.","At all zoom levels the car wash only fronts one major road (S Main St/US-96) and does not sit at the junction of two wide, high-traffic streets. The lot’s other boundaries abut residential parcels, open land, or private drives rather than a second main road. Because it lies mid-block on a single arterial and is not on a visible corner intersection of two major streets, it meets the definition of an Inside Lot."

While the lot is near a busy street, it does not meet the criteria to be classified as a corner lot.","The car wash sits directly at the signalized intersection of two multi-lane thoroughfares (US-41 running north–south and a wide state route running east–west). In all zoom levels you can see medians, dedicated turn lanes, crosswalk markings and highway shields on both adjacent roads. The lot has frontage on both major roads, meeting the criteria for a Corner Lot."

The lot visibly faces both roads, meeting the criteria for a 'Corner Lot'. It is adjacent to significant traffic features like multiple lanes on Highway 41 and a well-defined intersection with turn lanes and clear signage. Therefore, it qualifies as a Corner Lot based on the provided criteria description.","At all zoom levels the red-circled car wash only has direct frontage on Mars Hill Road and lies mid-block between minor access drives (Ballenger Road to the north and Ivey Lane to the south). The adjacent service drive to the west and the US-41 highway are not directly accessible and do not form a second major intersection. No two wide, named through-streets meet at the lot, and its other sides border parking lots, so it is an Inside Lot."

These are recognized major roads due to their multiple lanes and high connectivity, confirming the location as a corner lot.","At all zoom levels the BlueWave Express sits only along the Texas 35 Service Road (a frontage road) and an internal private access drive serving the adjacent retail parcels. It does not front onto two public arterials – the opposite side is a narrow shopping-center driveway, not a major street. No intersection of two wide, publicly maintained roads meets at the red-circled lot, so it is an inside lot rather than a corner lot."

From the images at varying zoom levels, it's observable that the lot faces directly onto these major roads, fulfilling the criteria for a corner lot.","The BlueWave car wash only fronts on one major road (Farm-to-Market Rd 375). The other side of the lot abuts an internal service drive within the retail center, not a second main thoroughfare.
