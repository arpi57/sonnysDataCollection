The only other roads touching the lot (Jones St, Cleveland St and S 3rd St) are narrow local/residential streets, not major multi-lane roads. Because it does not occupy the corner of two primary roads but instead sits between minor cross-streets and faces only Paris Rd, it meets the definition of an Inside Lot."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,Inside,"At all zoom levels the car wash only directly fronts one high-volume arterial (Prince Street/State Route 209). The street on the opposite side (Ross Street) is a narrower local road, not a multi-lane highway or major cross-arterial. There is no intersection of two primary roads bounding the red-circled lot, so it does not occupy a true corner of two major thoroughfares."
"ALL STAR CAR WASH , 5835 N Market St , Shreveport , LA , 71107",32.6003451,-93.841208,32.6003451,-93.841208,,Inside,"At the red-circled car wash site, only one major road (US 1) runs directly alongside the lot. The adjacent Gary Place is a two-lane local access road rather than a second multi-lane or named highway. There is no intersection of two major roads bounding the property; all other bordering drives are private or service entrances. Therefore, the car wash sits mid-block on a single main thoroughfare and qualifies as an Inside Lot."

Both streets are wide, clearly marked arterial roads with turn lanes and traffic controls. The red-circled lot fronts on both roads, forming a visible corner rather than lying mid-block, which meets the criteria for a Corner Lot."

The only other streets abutting the lot are residential/side streets (10th Ave SE, 11th Ave SE) with single-lane traffic and no turn lanes, signals, or highway shields. No two wide, primary roads form a corner around the red-circled parcel, so it meets the criteria of an Inside Lot rather than a Corner Lot."

The lot has curb cuts onto both of these major roads, and two of its sides face them, forming a visible corner rather than lying mid-block. Lane markings, turn arrows, and bus stops confirm both streets’ primary status, meeting the criteria for a corner lot."

The car wash has frontage on both streets, with visible turn lanes on Craft Drive and wide curb cuts on Hartman Way. Because it sits at the intersection of these two principal roads, it meets the definition of a corner lot."

There is no intersection of two main roads directly adjacent to the lot – only one major road and one minor access drive – so it does not meet the Corner Lot criteria."

Both roadways are wide, multi‐lane thoroughfares with marked turn lanes and a clear intersection adjacent to the red-circled lot. The building and its drive aisles front on both S Main Street and Christus Parkway, meeting the criteria for a Corner Lot."

In all zoom levels you can see both wide roadways meeting adjacent to the lot, complete with turn lanes and crosswalk markings, and the building fronts on both streets. These are not small service drives or alleys but primary roads, so the site clearly occupies a true corner lot."
"All Washed Up Canonsburg , 405 Old Pike St , Canonsburg , PA , 15317",40.2614149,-80.1747502,40.2614149,-80.1747502,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Corner,"All three zoom levels show the car wash lot sitting at the junction of two major roads (Morganza Road and Weavertown Road). At the broadest view (zoom 17) you can clearly see a multi-lane arterial (Morganza Rd) intersecting another wide, signed road (Weavertown Rd) immediately adjacent to the red-circled property. The mid-level zoom (18) shows curb cuts and driveways entering directly onto both roads, and multiple turn lanes and crosswalk markings at the intersection. The tightest zoom (19) confirms the lot faces both main streets at the corner of the ‘V’ they form — it is not mid-block nor simply bound by service drives. These features satisfy the Corner Lot criteria."
"All Washed Up Dubois , 306 Liberty Blvd , DuBois , PA , 15801",41.1205763,-78.758636,41.120558,-78.758646,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Inside,"The car wash sits along a single four-lane arterial and does not border a second major road at the red-circled lot. On one side it faces a high-capacity street (with multiple lanes and turn arrows), but the opposite edge abuts Beaver Meadow Trail, which is a narrow park/service path rather than a true public roadway of comparable importance. There is no intersection of two wide, signed roads directly adjacent to the lot. Thus, it is an inside lot—mid-block along one main road without forming a corner of two major thoroughfares."
"All Washed Up Harmar , 2404 Freeport Rd , Pittsburgh , PA , 15238",40.5336038,-79.8458897,40.5336038,-79.8458897,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Inside,"The car wash sits mid-block along Freeport Road with only one true major‐road frontage. The lane to the north/west is a private service/exit ramp for the adjacent freeway, not a second arterial street. There is no intersection of two wide public roads at the circled lot, so it meets the definition of an inside lot."

The only other streets touching the red-circled parcel – Chrysler Avenue to the north and Constable Avenue to the south – are narrow residential streets, not major thoroughfares. There is no intersection of two wide, high-volume roads immediately adjacent to the lot, so it does not occupy a corner of two main roads. Thus it is an inside lot."
"All Washed Up Munhall , 630 William Marks Dr , Homestead , PA , 15120",40.4096318,-79.8993024,40.4096318,-79.8993024,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Inside,"At all zoom levels the lot fronts only one clear major road (E 8th Avenue) and backs onto a narrow service drive (William Marks Drive) alongside the railroad. There is no intersection of two wide, heavily marked public roads at the red-circled site. The side streets (Martha Street/William Marks Drive) are minor or private access ways. Thus the car wash does not occupy a corner of two major roads and should be classified as an Inside Lot."

While U.S.-40 runs a short distance to the north, the lot itself only fronts New Salem Road. Its opposite boundary is Mall Run Road, a private/service drive rather than a second main thoroughfare. Because only one wide public road borders the site and it is not located at a true crossroad of two major streets, this qualifies as an Inside Lot."
"Amaranth , 200 W Amaranth Ln , Lincoln , NE , 68523",40.7445062,-96.7255223,40.7441566,-96.7249173,Soapatopia Car Wash,Inside,"At all three zoom levels the car wash sits mid-block along W Denton Rd rather than at the junction of two major public roads. The lot’s only street frontage is on the four-lane W Denton Rd; the access on its north and west sides is onto the site’s private/service drives (W Amaranth Ln loop and the convenience-shop driveway), not another primary highway or arterial. There is no visible intersection of two major roads abutting the red-circled parcel, so it is an Inside Lot."

On the other side it borders a private drive/ramp and a minor side street (Felton Pl), not a second major thoroughfare. There is no two-highway or two-main-road intersection directly at the red-circled lot and only a single curb cut onto E Felton Rd. Therefore it does not occupy a corner of two major roads and must be classified as an Inside Lot."

Although Interstate 85 runs just to the east, it is separated by a wooded embankment and there is no direct curb cut or corner intersection. The lot sits mid-block along N Cooper Drive between a shopping center entrance and the highway, with access from one road only, making it an inside lot rather than a corner lot."

Although W 187th Terrace runs along its southern edge, that is a two-lane collector, and the eastern boundary is a local residential street (Vivian St) serving fast-food and housing. There is no intersection of two wide, high-capacity roads directly abutting the lot. Therefore it sits mid-block along Gardner rather than on the corner of two main roads, making it an Inside Lot."

There is no intersecting major street directly on its corner – the nearest cross-street and the highway off-ramp lie further down the block. Because the lot only fronts one wide, multi-lane road and is not at the junction of two main thoroughfares, it meets the definition of an Inside Lot."
"Avatar , 1623 S Poinciana Blvd , Kissimmee , FL , 34758",28.257958,-81.485298,28.2583112,-81.4856547,Waters Car Wash,Corner,"The red-circled car wash sits at the northeast corner of the intersection of two major multi-lane thoroughfares: S Poinciana Blvd (north–south) and Old Tampa Hwy (east–west).

The nearby east–west streets (Childs St to the north and local lanes to the south) are minor roads and do not form a two-major-road intersection at the lot. Because it does not occupy a corner of two primary thoroughfares, it is classified as an Inside Lot."

There is no intersection of two wide, labeled roads directly adjacent to the car wash; the access on the east side is a private driveway connecting into adjoining lots, not a public street. Therefore, the car wash lies mid-block along a single main road, making it an Inside Lot."

Higher zoom levels show that the only other bordering corridor is the Twin Cities Rail Trail (a bike/pedestrian path), and the nearest street intersections (Baxter St to the south and Moore/Monarch St to the north) are one or more parcels away. There are no two wide, officially named roads meeting at the site’s corner, so it does not fulfill the Corner Lot criteria and is therefore classified as an Inside Lot."

The red-circled parcel has street frontage and curb cuts on both of these main thoroughfares, and you can clearly see turn lanes and intersection markings where they meet. This meets the definition of a Corner Lot because two wide, important roads converge at the property’s boundary."

Its opposite side abuts an internal service drive serving several businesses rather than a second main road. Although Cottonvale Road lies to the north, the lot is set back and connected by a private access drive, not a direct frontage. Because there is no intersection of two major roads at the red-circled lot, it does not meet the Corner Lot criteria and is therefore an Inside Lot."

Although the multi-lane US-98/Three Sisters Springs Trail interchange lies a short distance to the west, the red-circled lot itself is east of the ramps and only fronts NE 5th St. on one side. The other lot boundaries are private service drives and parking areas shared with the adjacent Wawa and fast-food pads, not true public arteries. There is no intersection of two major roads immediately adjacent to the car wash, so it meets the criteria for an Inside Lot."

At least two wide roads meet adjacent to the lot, with dedicated turn lanes and a cloverleaf‐style on/off ramp visible in all zoom levels. Because the red-circled property fronts on both of these primary roads at their corner junction, it clearly qualifies as a Corner Lot."

The north–south access drive simply links that service drive to State Route 21/Chestnut Street one block away and carries only local traffic.

There are no turn-lane arrows or signed cross-traffic on that side street beyond the retail entrance. In contrast, E Ash St is the only true multi-lane, signalized thoroughfare bordering the lot.
