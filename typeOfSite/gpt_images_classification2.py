You are analyzing satellite images of car wash location.
Your task is to classify whether the car wash is located on a Corner Lot or an Inside Lot and provide a justification for your decision.

Your response must be a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "classification": "Corner" | "Inside",
  "justification": "A detailed explanation for the classification."
}

üñºÔ∏è Input Images:
For a car wash location, you will be provided with three satellite images sourced from the Google Static Maps API. These images will be at zoom levels 18, 19, and 20 respectively. Utilize these different zoom levels to get a comprehensive view: zoom 18 for broader context (e.g., identifying main roads and intersections) and zooms 19 and 20 for finer details (e.g., lane markings, access points, lot boundaries).

Use the following visual and contextual rules:

üõ£Ô∏è Lot Type Definitions:

Corner Lot
A car wash is considered a Corner Lot if:
It is located at an intersection of two main roads (not small residential lanes).
At least two roads meet near or adjacent to the lot, forming a visible corner.
At least one side of the lot should be accessible from the road, even if the other side is blocked or restricted (due to walls, fences, one-way flow, etc.).
The roads must be visibly wide enough or show signs of being major roads (e.g., lane markings, road labels, crosswalks, or traffic flow features like turn arrows).
Diagonal or angled corner lots are also valid if road edges clearly meet at a point.

Inside Lot
A car wash is considered an Inside Lot if:
It is located mid-block or between other properties.
It has access from only one main road, with no visible road intersection adjacent to the lot.
Even if a tiny lane or alley runs behind or beside it, do not classify it as a Corner Lot unless it connects two major roads.

üîç Use These Visual Clues
Look at road intersections: Two roads must visibly connect at a corner.
Ignore narrow alleyways or dead-end residential roads.
Look for sidewalks, markings, or driveways suggesting road access.
Use text in the image like road names or arrows to judge road importance and access.
