"*** StoneWash *** Car Care Center , 818 Paris Rd , Mayfield , KY , 42066",36.7325312,-88.6330322,36.7325312,-88.6330322,STONEWASH CAR CARE CENTER,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 the only dedicated queue for the Stonewash Car Care wash is the single short drive from the Paris Rd curb cut into the small entrance canopy – roughly 15–20 m long, or about 3–4 standard (5 m) car lengths. There are no parallel staging lanes, overflow bays or additional tunnels tied to this entrance (the large lot and wash bays north of the building belong to a different business). Customer parking stalls to the south and east are not used for queueing, so total stack-up capacity is well under 15 cars."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom 20 it’s clear there is only a single entry lane wrapping from the curb‐cut on Prince St into the wash. Measuring by car lengths (~5 m each), the straight run from the street to the infeed is about 6–7 car lengths, with room for maybe another 1–2 cars through the slight curve—totaling under 10 cars. There are no parallel or overflow lanes alongside the building, only the one queue on the east side. Therefore the waiting area cannot accommodate fifteen full-sized vehicles bumper-to-bumper."
"ALL STAR CAR WASH , 5835 N Market St , Shreveport , LA , 71107",32.6003451,-93.841208,32.6003451,-93.841208,,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 we can see there is only a single drive-up lane feeding the wash building (the curved lane off the street) and a short wrap-around spur behind it.  Estimating a full-size car at ≈5 m, the inbound leg holds about 8 cars bumper-to-bumper before the building entrance, and the rear return spur adds another 3–4 cars.  There are no additional parallel queuing lanes or overflow bays dedicated to stacking, and the vacuum stations at the side are not part of the entry queue.  Total capacity is therefore under 15 vehicles."
"Abercorn , 10509 Abercorn St , Savannah , GA , 31419",31.9858522,-81.1330952,31.9856125,-81.1327189,LUV Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At Zoom 20, the only dedicated pre-wash queue is the two short pay lanes under the small gabled canopy on the south side of the wash tunnels.  Measuring end-to-end from the property entrance (at the curb cut off Abercorn) back to the face of the pay canopy is roughly 45 m – about nine 5 m car-lengths in a single lane.  Although there are two parallel pay lanes, each holds only about 5–6 cars before the merge; together they accommodate at most 10–12 cars.  There are no additional overflow bays or extended spill-out lanes intended for queuing, so the total stack-up capacity is under fifteen cars."
"Alabaster Wash and Wax , 916 1st St S , Alabaster , AL , 35007",33.2331449,-86.8116296,33.2331449,-86.81162959999999,Alabaster Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution we can see two serpentine queue lanes feeding the wash entrance on the building’s east side.  Using a 5 m-per-car rule of thumb (one car length ≈5 m):

• Outer loop: approximately 20–25 m of continuous queuing space (4–5 car lengths).
• Inner loop: about 15–20 m long (3–4 car lengths).

No additional overflow bays or long straight-in lanes are present. Summing the two parallel serpentine queues yields roughly 8–10 total car-lengths of capacity – clearly under the 15-car threshold."
"Alameda , 395 Alameda Blvd NW , Albuquerque , NM , 87114",35.1891491,-106.6161158,35.1891633,-106.616062,Champion Xpress Carwash,15 or more cars,"The dedicated ingress lane begins at the driveway on Alameda Blvd, runs north up the east side of the tunnel building (roughly 20 m long, about 4 car‐lengths), then turns west behind the building and continues for about 80 m (roughly 16 car‐lengths) before reaching the wash entrance. Even conservatively splitting that rear stretch into 60 m (12 cars) plus the 20 m side leg (4 cars) gives a total queuing space of at least 16 cars. This exceeds the 15-car threshold."
"Alamosa , 51 Craft Dr , Alamosa , CO , 81101",37.4765837,-105.8945442,37.4765318,-105.8944942,Champion Xpress Carwash,Less than 15 cars,"I traced the single entry queue from the curb cut off Craft Drive all the way around to the two wash‐bay conveyors on the north side of the building.  Breaking it into three segments:  (1) the straight approach from the curb cut into the curved apron is about 20 m long (≈4 car lengths), (2) the semicircular hold‐point in the padded apron west of the curb cut is about 15 m (≈3 cars), and (3) the final straight run right up to the twin conveyors measures roughly 30 m end to end (≈6 cars).  Even if you split that last segment into the two parallel lanes in front of each bay, the total bump-to-bumper capacity sums to about 13 cars – under the 15-car threshold."
"All American Big Spring , 513 W Marcy Dr , Big Spring , TX , 79720",32.2284801,-101.4727633,32.2284353,-101.473089,All American Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution the only queuing space is the short, 15–20 m dirt access spur immediately behind the red marker – roughly 3–4 car-lengths (5 m per car) end-to-end. There are no parallel holding lanes or overflow bays, and the curved drive around the wash appears to be the exit route, not an entry queue. In total, the visible stack-up area holds fewer than fifteen full-sized vehicles, so it classifies as “Less than 15 cars.”"
"All American Boerne , 1376 S Main St , Boerne , TX , 78006",29.7768476,-98.726846,29.7768476,-98.726846,All American Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At Zoom 20 you can clearly see only one continuous queuing lane hugging the east side of the building from the red‐dot entrance, curving around to the wash bay. Measuring that lane end-to-end gives roughly 60–65 m of usable stacking space. At an average full-size car length of 5 m, this equates to about 12–13 cars bumper-to-bumper. There are no parallel or overflow lanes adding extra capacity, so the total stack-up is under 15 cars."
"All American Car Wash , 917 N 7th St , Vincennes , IN , 47591",38.6808632,-87.5201897,38.6808632,-87.5201897,All American Car Wash and Express Lube,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution the wash has only a single short entry lane leading into the tunnel bay under the south‐side canopy. From the street curb to the mouth of the tunnel is roughly 25 m, or about five standard (5 m) car lengths. There is no parallel overflow queue or secondary spur that adds significant length – the adjacent vacuum island (the circular painted area) holds 2–3 cars but is clearly separate from the wash entry. Altogether the dedicated queuing space totals fewer than 15 bumper-to-bumper vehicles."
"All Washed Up Canonsburg , 405 Old Pike St , Canonsburg , PA , 15317",40.2614149,-80.1747502,40.2614149,-80.17475019999999,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 we can see only a single entry queue that wraps around the southeast corner of the building from Old Pike St.  Measuring roughly 5 m per car: the straight run from the property line to the start of the curve is ~10 m (≈2 cars), the curved section around the building is ~25 m (≈5 cars), and there’s room for one more car immediately in front of the tunnel door.  All other lanes on site are exit lanes or vacuum stalls (not counted).  Total continuous queuing capacity is about 8 cars maximum, well under the 15-car threshold."
"All Washed Up Dubois , 306 Liberty Blvd , DuBois , PA , 15801",41.1205763,-78.758636,41.120557999999996,-78.758646,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution the only queuing area is the single drive-through entrance on the west side of the building. Measuring that approach from the public roadway to the wash bay door yields roughly 20–25 m of usable stacking length – about four to five standard (5 m) cars bumper-to-bumper. There is no parallel or overflow bay; no secondary spur lanes; and no extended waiting apron behind the building entrance. In total the entire facility can only accommodate fewer than 15 cars in the queue, so it falls into the “Less than 15 cars” category."
"All Washed Up Harmar , 2404 Freeport Rd , Pittsburgh , PA , 15238",40.5336038,-79.8458897,40.5336038,-79.8458897,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom 20 you can clearly see only two dedicated, channelized queue lanes feeding the wash bays on the building’s front façade. I measured each lane at roughly 25 m long (about 5 car-lengths) on the right lane and about 20 m (4 car-lengths) on the left lane – for a total of ≈9 cars. The curved drive approach from Freeport Road is only about 2–3 car-lengths long per side and is not striped as a waiting lane, so it isn’t counted as part of the official stack-up. There are no overflow bays or additional parallel spurs beyond these two front lanes. Therefore the visible, intended queuing area accommodates fewer than 15 cars."
"All Washed Up Johnstown , 1119 Scalp Ave , Johnstown , PA , 15904",40.281186,-78.8627293,40.281186,-78.8627293,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 15 cars,"At high‐resolution (zoom 20) there is only a single short apron from Scalp Ave into the wash bay. Measuring in the image, that paved approach is about 8–10 m long (roughly 1.5–2 car-lengths @ ~5 m each) with no secondary or overflow lanes and no parallel stacking area. The surrounding areas are grass or customer parking, not dedicated queuing lanes. Therefore the off-street stack-up capacity is well under fifteen cars."
"All Washed Up Munhall , 630 William Marks Dr , Homestead , PA , 15120",40.4096318,-79.8993024,40.4096318,-79.8993024,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 15 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution we can clearly make out two green-roofed pay booths feeding into a single automated tunnel.  Measuring by car-lengths (~5 m each):
• Each of the two parallel concrete pay-lanes is about 25 m long from the property line to the tunnel entrance, so roughly 5 car-lengths per lane.  
• After the two lanes merge, there is only another 10 m (≈2 car-lengths) of queuing before the wash door.  
Summing those gives 2 lanes ×5 cars +2 cars ≈12 cars total.  There are no additional overflow or bypass bays, so the maximum on-site stack-up is under 15 cars."

There are no visible ingress lanes, bay spurs, or overflow areas where cars could line up. Even if you assume a single informal lane along the adjacent roadway, there is space for only a handful of cars – certainly well under the 15-car threshold."
"Amaranth , 200 W Amaranth Ln , Lincoln , NE , 68523",40.7445062,-96.7255223,40.7441566,-96.7249173,Soapatopia Car Wash,Less than 15 cars,"At Zoom-20 the car wash only has a single narrow queuing lane that comes around the west end of the blue-roofed wash building, plus a very short stub by the exit at the east end.  Using the six-lane roadway at the bottom of the image (≈21–25 m wide) as a reference, one full-sized car length is roughly 5 m.  The curved approach lane on the west measures only about 20 m in total (≈4 car-lengths), and the stub on the east side another ≈10 m (≈2 car-lengths).  There are no parallel queuing bays or overflow lanes visible.  Combined capacity is therefore on the order of 6 cars, well under the 15-car threshold."

Breaking it into three straight-away segments and converting each segment to ~5 m per car:  • From the bay throat to the first 90° bend is ~15 m (≈3 cars)  • From that bend down to the second curve is ~25 m (≈5 cars)  • From the second curve back toward the entry point is ~20 m (≈4 cars) Total theoretical capacity ≈3+5+4=12 cars.  Even allowing a couple of cars in the corner radii, it does not reach 15 full-sized vehicles.  Therefore this stack-up is “Less than 15 cars.”"

There is a short 2–car-length stub just before the bay door, but no parallel queue or overflow bay.  In total this single lane only holds about 9–10 full-size vehicles bumper-to-bumper, well under the 15-car threshold."

Measuring by standard car lengths (~5 m each):
• On the north side of the building you can fit roughly 4 vehicles bumper-to-bumper in the straight portion leading up to the wash bay.  
• As that lane curves around the west end it adds another ~5 car lengths of queue.
• Even if you include the very short stub just inside the gate, you reach only about 9–10 cars in a continuous line.  There are no parallel overflow lanes or additional spur bays feeding the tunnel.  Therefore total stack-up capacity is under the 15-car threshold."
