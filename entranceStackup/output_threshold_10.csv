"*** StoneWash *** Car Care Center , 818 Paris Rd , Mayfield , KY , 42066",36.7325312,-88.6330322,36.7325312,-88.6330322,STONEWASH CAR CARE CENTER,Less than 10 cars,"In the zoom-20 image you can see only one narrow drive-in lane serving the bay plus a small side-pad.  Estimating one full-size car at ~5 m end-to-end, the lane from the Paris Road curb cut back to the wash bay door is roughly 20 m (≈4 car-lengths), and the little overflow apron beside it is only about 10 m (≈2 car-lengths).  There are no additional parallel queue lanes or longer overflow bays.  Total visible stacking room is about 6 cars, well under the 10-car threshold."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution the car wash’s only designated queuing area is the single ingress lane wrapping along the east side of the tunnel‐wash building. That lane measures roughly 25–30 m end-to-end – enough room for about 5–6 average 5 m cars – plus you can park one car immediately inside the entry bollards, for a total of roughly 7 cars maximum. There are no parallel or overflow lanes, and no auxiliary spur lanes visible. Altogether the available stack-up space clearly falls below the 10-car threshold."
"ALL STAR CAR WASH , 5835 N Market St , Shreveport , LA , 71107",32.6003451,-93.841208,32.6003451,-93.841208,,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution one car is about 5 m long.  The only dedicated queuing lane is the one-way drive that wraps from the south entrance around the west side of the building up to the twin wash bays on the east.  That curved lane measures roughly 30 m end-to-end (≈6 cars bumper-to-bumper) before it splits into two very short spur lanes.  Each spur holds just 1–2 cars, and the little straight stub north of the building (which often functions as a bypass/egress more than true queueing space) only fits about 2–3 cars.  Even if you count every possible driveway segment, the total capacity barely reaches eight cars in the intended queue.  There is no continuous run of ten or more car–lengths, so this location falls into the “Less than 10 cars” category."
"Abercorn , 10509 Abercorn St , Savannah , GA , 31419",31.9858522,-81.1330952,31.9856125,-81.1327189,LUV Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 you can see the car-wash has only two very short parallel feed lanes at the entry (just north of the gabled wash canopy) before they merge into the tunnels.  Each of those lanes is only about 4 car-lengths long (≈20 m), so 2 lanes × 4 cars = 8 cars.  There is no long overflow bay or extra spur lane—the only additional space is the narrow drive-in between the Jiffy Lube building and the wash, which only holds 1–2 cars before you hit the merge.  Summing up the two main queue lanes (8 cars) plus at most 1–2 cars in the approach drive gives under 10 cars total, so this location classifies as “Less than 10 cars.”"
"Alabaster Wash and Wax , 916 1st St S , Alabaster , AL , 35007",33.2331449,-86.8116296,33.2331449,-86.81162959999999,Alabaster Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution, I can see only a single ingress lane for cars waiting to enter the wash — there are no parallel or overflow spur lanes. Measuring end-to-end from the driveway entrance at 1st St S around the east side of the building to the wash opening is roughly 40–45 meters. At about 5 meters per car, that equates to around 8 standard vehicles. The curved vacuum/parking loop on the east side is clearly vacuum bays (customer parking after wash), not part of the queue for the tunnel. Because there is only one continuous lane holding about eight cars and no secondary queue, total stack-up capacity is under 10 cars."
"Alameda , 395 Alameda Blvd NW , Albuquerque , NM , 87114",35.1891491,-106.6161158,35.1891633,-106.616062,Champion Xpress Carwash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom 20 the only dedicated queue for the tunnel is the single‐file feed lane on the building’s east side and a short straight behind the roofline. Measuring by car‐lengths (≈5 m each), the entry spur is about 20 m long (≈4 cars) and the next straight segment behind the building adds only another 10–15 m (≈2–3 cars) before it merges into the general circulation aisle. There are no overflow bays or parallel pre-wash lanes. Total dedicated queuing capacity is therefore under ten cars."
"Alamosa , 51 Craft Dr , Alamosa , CO , 81101",37.4765837,-105.8945442,37.4765318,-105.8944942,Champion Xpress Carwash,10 or more cars,"At zoom 20 you can see that vehicles queue up from Craft Drive into a single approach lane that is roughly 40 m long (about eight 5 m car-lengths) before splitting into three parallel bays on the north side of the building. Each of those bays is itself roughly 25 m long (about five car-lengths) underneath the conveyor canopies. Summing the three bay capacities (3 × 5 cars = 15 cars) plus the 8-car approach gives a total theoretical queue of about 23 cars, well above the 10-car threshold."
"All American Big Spring , 513 W Marcy Dr , Big Spring , TX , 79720",32.2284801,-101.4727633,32.2284353,-101.473089,All American Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At Zoom 20 there is only a single narrow ingress lane running from Coronado Drive (just west of the red dot) into the wash building. Measuring in car-lengths (≈5 m each), the paved lane from the property line to the entrance canopy is about 4–5 cars long. There are no parallel or overflow queue spurs; the vacuum stalls along the north side are customer post-wash bays (not counted). Even including the short exit lane (2–3 cars), total stack-up capacity is under 10 vehicles."
"All American Boerne , 1376 S Main St , Boerne , TX , 78006",29.7768476,-98.726846,29.7768476,-98.726846,All American Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At Zoom 20 you can see that there is only a single one‐way queue lane feeding the wash door on the east side of the building – no parallel or overflow bays.  Measuring end-to-end from the curb cut on Christus Pkwy, around the building’s south side, and up alongside the east wall to the wash entrance is about 45 m of usable queuing lane.  Assuming a 5 m average car length, that translates to roughly 8–9 cars bumper-to-bumper.  Because there is only one narrow looping lane and it clearly accommodates fewer than ten vehicles in line, we classify this as “Less than 10 cars.”"
"All American Car Wash , 917 N 7th St , Vincennes , IN , 47591",38.6808632,-87.5201897,38.6808632,-87.5201897,All American Car Wash and Express Lube,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom 20 the shop only has a single narrow ingress lane running along the east side of the building, roughly 35 meters from the curb cut on N 7th down to the bay door – about seven 5 m car-lengths end-to-end. There is no parallel overflow lane or second queue, and the small stub of driveway on the south side only adds another two lengths but is clearly for exiting/vacuum use rather than stacking into the tunnel. Even if you generously include it, you get under ten cars total on the property’s dedicated queue lanes, so this site falls into the “Less than 10 cars” category."
"All Washed Up Canonsburg , 405 Old Pike St , Canonsburg , PA , 15317",40.2614149,-80.1747502,40.2614149,-80.17475019999999,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 detail the car‐wash has only a single serpentine drive-through lane wrapping around one side of the building.  I estimate the waiting lane length at roughly 35–40 meters total (about 7–8 car lengths at ~5 m per car).  There are no additional parallel or overflow bays beyond the single narrow loop.  Even if you include the 10–15 m approach on Old Pike Street, the combined queue capacity is under 10 full-sized vehicles.  Therefore this location qualifies as “Less than 10 cars.”"
"All Washed Up Dubois , 306 Liberty Blvd , DuBois , PA , 15801",41.1205763,-78.758636,41.120557999999996,-78.758646,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20 resolution the wash has only a single inbound queue from the public drive into the bay. That lane measures roughly 25–30 m from the public entry to the conveyor door, which at ~5 m per car equals about 5–6 cars bumper-to-bumper. There are no parallel overflow lanes or secondary spurs visible; the adjacent stalls are customer parking, not queue space. Total stack-up capacity is therefore well under 10 vehicles."
"All Washed Up Harmar , 2404 Freeport Rd , Pittsburgh , PA , 15238",40.5336038,-79.8458897,40.5336038,-79.8458897,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"When measured at zoom-20 scale (≈5 m per car length), the two parallel entrance lanes on the south side each only stretch about 15–20 m from curb to wash entry.  The western queue holds roughly 3 cars end-to-end, the eastern queue about 4–5 cars, for a combined total under 10 cars.  There are no additional overflow bays or extended lanes elsewhere, so the stack-up capacity is less than 10 cars."
"All Washed Up Johnstown , 1119 Scalp Ave , Johnstown , PA , 15904",40.281186,-78.8627293,40.281186,-78.8627293,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"At Zoom 20, the car-wash has only a single narrow inbound lane in front of the building.  From the bay door to the street curb is roughly 8–10 m of clear queuing space – about 1.5 to 2 full-sized cars end-to-end.  There are no parallel or overflow lanes alongside the building, nor any extended apron behind or beside the wash bay.  In total, the site can accommodate only 1–2 waiting vehicles, which is well below the 10-car threshold."
"All Washed Up Munhall , 630 William Marks Dr , Homestead , PA , 15120",40.4096318,-79.8993024,40.4096318,-79.8993024,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom level 20 you can clearly see the car-wash has only a single narrow queue lane that wraps around the building’s west and north sides before the tunnel entrance.  Measuring in 5 m car-lengths, the straight run behind the building is only about 6 lengths (≈30 m) and the side leg down toward the tunnel adds another 3–4 lengths (≈15–20 m).  Even if every inch were used perfectly, this lane only accommodates around 9–10 cars bumper-to-bumper – well under the 15-car (10-car) threshold, so it classifies as “Less than 10 cars.”"
"All Washed Up Uniontown , 15 New Salem Rd , Uniontown , PA , 15401",39.9105773,-79.7474519,39.9105773,-79.7474519,All Washed Up Auto Spa,Less than 10 cars,"At both zoom levels there are no dedicated queuing lanes or overflow bays drawn out – the red-circled area is simply an open grassy pad with no pavement markings or curb cuts for a car‐wash lineup. The only nearby paved area belongs to the adjacent Sheetz, and even if you treated those fueling lanes as a queue they hold only 1–2 cars per pump (max 6–8 cars) before blocking circulation. There is no single continuous lane or parallel lanes adding up to ten 5 m car lengths, so the stack-up capacity here is well under 10 cars."
"Amaranth , 200 W Amaranth Ln , Lincoln , NE , 68523",40.7445062,-96.7255223,40.7441566,-96.7249173,Soapatopia Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom 20 we can see only a single narrow drive-through lane wrapping one side of the wash building, with no parallel ­overflow or holding bays.  Measuring the curb-to-curb approach from the lot edge to the tunnel entrance is roughly 25 m – about 5 full‐sized cars bumper-to-bumper – and then another ~15 m around the corner (≈3 cars).  There are no additional lanes to sum, so the total continuous queuing space is under 10 car-lengths."
"American Pride Smithfield , 1203 N Brightleaf Blvd , Smithfield , NC , 27577",35.5195152,-78.3146416,35.5195152,-78.3146416,American Pride Xpress Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom-20, the only dedicated stack-up is on the building’s east side.  Measuring against a ~5 m car‐length, the single entrance lane from the parking-lot drive is about 30 m long (≈6 cars) before it splits into two pay lanes.  Each pay lane is roughly 10–12 m (≈2–3 cars), or about 4–5 cars total across both lanes, and then merges into the tunnel with room for only one more car ahead of the belt.  In practice you can stage about 8–9 vehicles bumper-to-bumper before blocking the lot; there is no overflow bay or additional parallel queue.  That falls under the 10-car threshold."
"Aqua Breeze Car Wash , 150 E Felton Rd , Cartersville , GA , 30120",34.1971313,-84.7921299,34.197131299999995,-84.79212989999999,Aqua Breeze Car Wash,Less than 10 cars,"At zoom 20 the only dedicated queue is the single drive-thru lane wrapping around the east side of the building. From the entrance at E Felton Rd to the service window is only about three to four 5-m car-lengths, with another one or two lengths possible in the small runoff immediately behind the window before the lane exits. There are no parallel or overflow bays to add capacity. In total this single narrow loop holds roughly five cars end-to-end, well under the ten-car threshold."

Measuring roughly 5 m per car, I count about 4 car-lengths from the entrance driveway up to the wash tunnel door, plus another 3–4 car-lengths around the curve on the building’s north side before the lane rejoins the exit.  There are no parallel overflow bays or extra spur lanes.  The total visible queuing distance would accommodate only about 7–8 full-size vehicles bumper-to-bumper, which is under the 10-car threshold."
