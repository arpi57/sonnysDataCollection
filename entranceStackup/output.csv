"*** StoneWash *** Car Care Center , 818 Paris Rd , Mayfield , KY , 42066",36.7325312,-88.6330322,36.7325312,-88.6330322,STONEWASH CAR CARE CENTER,2,"On the west face of the Stonewash Car Care building there is only one un-marked drive-up apron between the three service doors and Paris Road. Measuring that apron in the Zoom-20 image gives roughly 12–15 m of clear space (each full-size car ≈5 m long), so you could squeeze in at most two cars behind a bay door without blocking the public right-of-way. There are no parallel or overflow lanes, no painted queue lines, and adjacent parking stalls are for long-term parking, not staging."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,8,"At zoom-20 you can see that the only true waiting lane is the single‐lane drive that runs from the curb cut off Prince St (right side of the image) back to the tunnel entrance on the north face of the rectangular car-wash building.  Measuring that run against the row of bollards directly in front of the building (each bollard spaced roughly one 5 m car-length apart) shows room for about six cars end-to-end before you hit the building face.  In addition, the sweep of pavement around the southeast corner holds room for roughly two more cars tucked just before the entrance gate.  We do not count the vacuum bays on the rear canopy or adjacent parking stalls, so total stack-up capacity in the waiting lane is 8 cars."
"ALL STAR CAR WASH , 5835 N Market St , Shreveport , LA , 71107",32.6003451,-93.841208,32.6003451,-93.841208,,0,"There are no visible wash bays, tunnel, or designated queuing lanes for a car wash in the marked area – it’s a drive-thru coffee shop with parking stalls, not a car wash. Therefore the car‐wash stack-up capacity is zero."
"Abercorn , 10509 Abercorn St , Savannah , GA , 31419",31.9858522,-81.1330952,31.9856125,-81.1327189,LUV Car Wash,6,"On the zoom-20 view there are two marked inbound queue lanes on the north side of the wash building (you can see the white directional arrows on the concrete).  Measuring from the first arrow (just east of the Jiffy Lube roof) back to the start of the washing bays is roughly 15 m of drive lane – about three 5 m car-lengths.  Since there are two parallel lanes, each holding about 3 cars end-to-end, total stack-up capacity is approximately 2 lanes × 3 cars = 6 cars.  No other dedicated queue or overflow bay is visible, and customer parking/vacuum stalls have been excluded from this count."
"Alabaster Wash and Wax , 916 1st St S , Alabaster , AL , 35007",33.2331449,-86.8116296,33.2331449,-86.81162959999999,Alabaster Car Wash,15,"At Zoom 20 resolution we can see the single serpentine queue lane that snakes from the 1st St S entry around two sweeping curves into the wash building. Using an average car length of ~5 m, we break the lane into four countable segments: (1) the straight run from the street curb cut to the first bend holds about 4 cars, (2) the run from the first bend down to the second bend holds about 5 cars, (3) the run from the second bend back up to the final merge point holds about 4 cars, and (4) a short approach immediately before the wash entrance holds about 2 cars. Summing these gives a total stack-up capacity of 15 vehicles in the designated queue lane."
"Alameda , 395 Alameda Blvd NW , Albuquerque , NM , 87114",35.1891491,-106.6161158,35.1891633,-106.616062,Champion Xpress Carwash,9,"I treated a typical full-size car at zoom 20 as roughly 5 m long. The single‐file queue snakes in from the lot entrance on the east side, up the right‐hand (north–south) lane and then west along the north side of the wash entry.  • The north–south approach from the drive-in to the 90° curve measures about 20 m, enough room for roughly 4 cars end-to-end.  • The westward leg from that turn to the wash bay door is roughly 25 m, fitting about 5 cars.  Adding those two segments yields a stack-up capacity of 9 cars queued outside the wash entrance (not counting any vehicle already in the bay)."
"Alamosa , 51 Craft Dr , Alamosa , CO , 81101",37.4765837,-105.8945442,37.4765318,-105.8944942,Champion Xpress Carwash,13,"At zoom-20 detail I estimated a standard car length at roughly 5 m.  Starting at the Hartman Way curb cut on the building’s southwest corner the single-file lane runs north along the west wall for about 15 m (≈3 cars), then curves and continues east beside the building’s north face for roughly 40 m (≈8 cars) before splitting into two pre-bay spurs.  Each of those spurs is about 5 m long and holds one car each (2 cars total).  Summing 3 + 8 + 2 gives a maximum stack–up of about 13 cars, assuming compact 5 m spacing per vehicle."
"All American Big Spring , 513 W Marcy Dr , Big Spring , TX , 79720",32.2284801,-101.4727633,32.2284353,-101.473089,All American Car Wash,6,"In the high‐resolution (zoom 20) view you can clearly see only one dedicated entry lane (the unpaved strip running north–south between the houses and the wash building).  Measuring approximately 30 meters from the wash‐bay doors back to the turn‐in point from W Marcy Drive and dividing by a standard 5 m car length yields about 6 cars end-to-end.  There are no parallel or overflow lanes on the approach, and the three white rectangles to the east are vacuum stalls (exit side), not additional queue lanes, so the total stack-up capacity in the entry lane is 6 cars."
"All American Boerne , 1376 S Main St , Boerne , TX , 78006",29.7768476,-98.726846,29.7768476,-98.726846,All American Car Wash,12,"At zoom-20 resolution the single-lane queue can be broken into three measurable segments. 1) From the curb cut on Christus Pkwy to the first bend is roughly 15 m, or about 3 full-sized cars at 5 m each. 2) The long curved run northward around the building measures ~35 m, accommodating roughly 7 cars end-to-end. 3) The short holding zone immediately in front of the wash portal is ~10 m, for 2 more cars. There are no parallel lanes or overflow bays in the red-circled area; parking stalls are to the south and not part of the queue. Summing those segments gives a total stack-up capacity of approximately 12 vehicles."
"All American Car Wash , 917 N 7th St , Vincennes , IN , 47591",38.6808632,-87.5201897,38.6808632,-87.5201897,All American Car Wash and Express Lube,2,"At this location there is no dedicated tunnel-style queue lane – only the single pay-station canopy at the southwest corner of the building (you can see the small white canopy in the Zoom 20 view). From the edge of the canopy back to the tree line there is roughly 10 m of clear pavement (about two standard 5 m car lengths). There is no usable stacking space north or east of the building (those areas are public street or vacuum bays), and the larger striped pavement to the west is actually self-serve wash bays, not a queue. Therefore the only practical stack-up zone is at the pay kiosk and it will hold two full-size cars."
"All Washed Up Canonsburg , 405 Old Pike St , Canonsburg , PA , 15317",40.2614149,-80.1747502,40.2614149,-80.17475019999999,All Washed Up Auto Spa,6,"Reviewing the Zoom-20 image, the car-wash has a single identified ingress lane that begins at the pay kiosk at the loop (bottom-right of the building) and runs into the tunnel entrance on the east side of the structure.  Measuring that lane against the eight adjacent parking stalls (each ≈2.5 m wide) shows the long section alongside the building is about 20 m, or four car lengths, and the short run from the kiosk to the start of the building face is another ≈7 m (just over one car length).  In practice you load one vehicle at the kiosk plus four queued alongside the building, plus one straggler in the short pre-entry segment – for a total of approximately six full-sized vehicles in the designated stack-up lane.  There are no parallel overflow spurs; the vacuum bays to the northeast are customer stalls, not queue lanes."
"All Washed Up Dubois , 306 Liberty Blvd , DuBois , PA , 15801",41.1205763,-78.758636,41.120557999999996,-78.758646,All Washed Up Auto Spa,6,"On the zoom-20 image you can clearly make out a single, dedicated ingress lane running along the north face of the wash building. From the curb-cut at the lot entrance all the way back to the bay door measures roughly 30 m of clear, head-to-tail pavement.  Dividing that into standard 5 m car-lengths yields six vehicles (30 m / 5 m≈6).  There are no parallel or marked spill-over spurs dedicated to queueing, and the adjacent white-lined parking stalls are for customer parking – not part of the stack-up.  Therefore, the site can accommodate six full-sized cars in its waiting lane."
"All Washed Up Harmar , 2404 Freeport Rd , Pittsburgh , PA , 15238",40.5336038,-79.8458897,40.5336038,-79.8458897,All Washed Up Auto Spa,8,At zoom-20 I traced the one continuous single-lane queue from the Freeport Rd entrance (lower right) all the way around to the wash tunnel inlet (under the red dot). Breaking it into five pieces and estimating ~5 m per car: 1) the straight run in from the road before even hitting the curve ≈2 cars; 2) the initial curve around the southeast corner ≈1 car; 3) the straight section along the building’s east flank ≈2 cars; 4) the curve around the northeast corner ≈1 car; and 5) the final straight jog into the wash entrance ≈2 cars. Summing to about 8 full-sized vehicles. I ignored the vacuum stalls/angled parking at the front and counted only the inbound queue lane intended for cars waiting to enter the wash.
"All Washed Up Johnstown , 1119 Scalp Ave , Johnstown , PA , 15904",40.281186,-78.8627293,40.281186,-78.8627293,All Washed Up Auto Spa,1,"At Zoom 20 the only dedicated queue is the narrow paved approach from Scalp Avenue into the bay.  I measured that apron at roughly 5 m long (≈1 mid-sized car), and there is no parallel or overflow lane on either side of the building.  No further paved length is available for cars to stack, so the single bay approach can only hold one vehicle at a time."
"All Washed Up Munhall , 630 William Marks Dr , Homestead , PA , 15120",40.4096318,-79.8993024,40.4096318,-79.8993024,All Washed Up Auto Spa,11,"On the Zoom-20 image the single-file entry lane starts at the curb cut on William Marks Dr and snakes around the east side of the blue-roofed tunnel.  Measuring by eye one standard car (≈5 m) corresponds to about 10–12 px in the image.  The straight north–south leg from the street to the beginning of the bend is roughly 25 m (≈5 car lengths).  The 180° curve plus the final straight into the tunnel door runs another ≈35 m (≈7 car lengths).  That gives 12 total potential lengths, but allowing one-car clearance at the portal reduces the safe queue to 11 cars.  No other parallel stacking or overflow bays feed the tunnel entrance, so the total capacity is 11 vehicles."
"All Washed Up Uniontown , 15 New Salem Rd , Uniontown , PA , 15401",39.9105773,-79.7474519,39.9105773,-79.7474519,All Washed Up Auto Spa,0,"In both the zoom-19 and zoom-20 shots the red-circled area is nothing but open grass with no visible wash bays, ingress lanes or defined queue lanes. There are no curb cuts, painted arrows or pavement formations that would hold waiting vehicles. Thus, there is currently no formal stack-up capacity (0 cars)."
"Amaranth , 200 W Amaranth Ln , Lincoln , NE , 68523",40.7445062,-96.7255223,40.7441566,-96.7249173,Soapatopia Car Wash,9,"On the high-res (zoom 20) view you can clearly see a single, one-way queue lane that wraps the west side of the wash building and ties into the pump forecourt at the north end.  Measuring car-lengths at roughly 5 m each: 
 • Along the west flank of the building (from the pay/scan canopy at the north corner down to where the lane splits off by the grass pad) is about 35 m of usable queue space – enough room for roughly 6 full-size cars.  
 • Immediately north of the scan canopy is an additional ~10 m of straight-in approach that will hold 2 cars waiting to get under the canopy.  
 • Finally, one more car can sit under the small scan/pay canopy itself before entering the tunnel.  
Adding those segments gives 6 + 2 + 1 = 9 vehicles in the dedicated entrance stack-up lanes without spilling into other circulation areas."
"American Pride Smithfield , 1203 N Brightleaf Blvd , Smithfield , NC , 27577",35.5195152,-78.3146416,35.5195152,-78.3146416,American Pride Xpress Car Wash,18,"At zoom-20 you can clearly see two separate queue lanes feeding the two in-bay conveyors highlighted by the red dot.  By using an average 5 m (≈1 car) length as a ruler we get:  

• Conveyor staging zone (right up against the building): holds 2 cars side-by-side, one on each conveyor head  
• Inner short lane (behind conveyors, hugging the building): ≈20 m of length → 4 car-lengths  
• Outer long loop (from the merge point back around the right side and up to the entry drive): ≈60 m of length → 12 car-lengths  

Summing those gives 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 full-sized vehicles in the designated waiting lanes before they enter the wash bays."
"Aqua Breeze Car Wash , 150 E Felton Rd , Cartersville , GA , 30120",34.1971313,-84.7921299,34.197131299999995,-84.79212989999999,Aqua Breeze Car Wash,0,"At both zoom levels the purple-tinted structure is clearly a self-serve, coin-op car wash (vacuum bays on the east side, open wash stalls on the west) rather than a tunnel wash with a defined entry queue. There are no marked, end-to-end queuing lanes, spurs, or overflow bays leading into a single drive-through bay – just a general circulation drive aisle shared with neighboring businesses. Because customers pull directly into whichever open vacuum or wash stall is available and there is no dedicated stack-up lane, the car wash’s formal entrance stack-up capacity is effectively zero vehicles."
"Auto Suds Express West , 25th North 25th St. , Lebanon , PA , 17042",40.3402231,-76.4568065,40.340223099999996,-76.4568065,AutoSuds West Car Wash,5,"At zoom 20 you can see there is only a single‐lane drive-through queue on the east side of the building (the grey strip leading from the curb cut on N 25th St into the wash bay). I measured that lane from the property line to the wash entrance at roughly 25 meters in the satellite image. Dividing by a standard 5 m car length yields about 5 cars end-to-end. The curved loop on the north side is clearly part of the exit/vacuum area and not used for stacking into the tunnel, so it isn’t included in the calculation."
