This is the only place in town I would go to because of the true spot free rinse. Everything seemed to be going great until I checked my bank account and my car dried. I was charged $10 when the sign clearly says $5, and when my car dried there are spots all over the windows. There’s no phone number posted on the door, or anywhere that I can see, to call and inquire/ dispute about the charge, Or notify them that their spot free rinse is not working…there is no phone number posted online, no website—All I can do is post this review and dispute it through my bank, SMH.\n\nToday, I gave it another chance… I was hopeful that my previous experience was not going to be the new norm. To amend my previous review, after posting the review the $10 debit card processing/pending charge was adjusted to the advertised $5 by the time it posted to my account, which I appreciated. The stall I used this time didn’t have a new brush, but the brush that was there worked sufficiently. I used quarters instead, this time mostly because I had them already on-hand, So I can’t speak to whether they fixed the problem across the board (with using a debit card), or just with my experience/situation. Putting in $5 worth of quarters, the time does start counting down right away as you’re putting the quarters in, which is a little bit of a bummer, but I still got close to nine minutes of wash time. And most significantly for me, was to test the spot free rinse… Sadly, there are still spots… They must’ve changed something because this is the second time—different stall, same spotted result :( It did a fairly good job cleaning my vehicle, but because the spot-free rinse is no longer “spot-free” I couldn’t change the 1 Star rating to beyond 3 Stars… Seems I’m gonna have to look for a new car wash spot :(",
