# The Core Problem:

# Your Google Cloud Project, associated with the API key you are using, does not have the necessary "Asset Tracking license" (or equivalent entitlement) enabled to access the speed limit data.

# How to Potentially Resolve This:

#     Asset Tracking License:

#         The speed limit service within the Roads API is a premium feature. You generally need to be enrolled in Google's Asset Tracking solution or have a specific agreement with Google that grants access to this feature.

#         Action: You will likely need to contact Google Maps Platform Sales or your Google Cloud account representative to inquire about obtaining the necessary license or entitlement for your project.

#     Ensure Roads API is Enabled:

#         While the error points to a licensing issue for speed limits, double-check that the "Roads API" itself is enabled for your project in the Google Cloud Console.

#         Go to Google Cloud Console -> APIs & Services -> Library.

#         Search for "Roads API" and ensure it's enabled for the project tied to your API key.

#         If it's not, enable it. However, this alone won't solve the "Speed limits are not available for this project" error if the licensing is the root cause.

#     Billing Account:

#         Ensure your project is linked to an active and valid billing account. Most Google Maps Platform APIs require this.

#     API Key Restrictions:

#         If you have restricted your API key (e.g., to specific APIs or IP addresses), ensure that the Roads API is allowed and that your request isn't being blocked by other restrictions. However, the error PERMISSION_DENIED for the service suggests this is less likely the primary issue than the licensing.

# In summary, the most probable reason is the lack of an Asset Tracking license.

# What to do now:

#     Contact Google: This is your primary path. Explain that you want to use the speed limit feature of the Roads API and inquire about the necessary licensing or contract.

#     Consider Alternatives (if licensing is a blocker):

#         OpenStreetMap (OSM): OSM data often contains maxspeed tags. You would need to query OSM data (e.g., via the Overpass API or by downloading OSM extracts and using a tool like Osmosis or a GIS) and then process it yourself to find speed limits for your coordinates. This is more complex but free.

#         Other commercial providers: There are other companies that provide road data, including speed limits, but they will also have their own licensing and costs.

# The "key redacted" part is good practice, but the issue here isn't the key itself being invalid, but rather what that key (and its associated project) is authorized to do.
