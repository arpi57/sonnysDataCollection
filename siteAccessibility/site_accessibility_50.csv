The single curb cut into the shared lot is clearly visible from the main road and located at a gentle curve, making it intuitive to spot. Although the driveway is shared with an adjacent orthodontist, it isn’t embedded in a larger, confusing shopping‐center circulation and doesn’t compete with other heavy-turnover uses at the same entry point. Surrounding uses—including a fast-food restaurant just to the south—do create busier turning movements during peak periods, but the dedicated turn lane on Paris Road and the site’s prominent frontage keep access largely direct and unambiguous. These factors point to good accessibility with only minor potential conflicts, meriting an 8 out of 10."
"A-KEY CAR WASH , 2210 N Prince St , Clovis , NM , 88101",34.4211501,-103.1969689,34.4211501,-103.1969689,A-Key Car Wash,7,"The car wash sits one block off the four-lane arterial (Prince Street), accessed via Ross Street. There is no median on Prince Street, so drivers can make direct turns onto Ross Street in either direction.

The overall environment is a busy commercial corridor, so left-turns from Prince Street onto Ross Street (and then into the site) can be somewhat challenging during peak flow, but the path is straightforward and does not require navigating additional roads or complex intersections. These factors yield a ‘good’ score of 7 out of 10."

It has one clearly defined, dedicated curb cut onto the highway that is highly visible to drivers, but it is not located at the nearest signalized intersection (Gary Pl) and there is no median break at the driveway. As a result, eastbound drivers can only make a right-in/right-out, while westbound drivers must overshoot the entrance, U-turn at Gary Pl, then come back to enter—similarly, exiting customers cannot turn left toward the east without a U-turn. There is no shared driveway conflict with adjacent uses, but the multi-lane road, continuous median, and heavy cross-traffic create moderate constraints on ease of entry and exit."

The single driveway on Magnolia is clearly signed and visible, but is shared with an adjacent Jiffy Lube/retail pad and is located just off a signalized intersection. A median on Abercorn prevents direct left‐in/left‐out movements except via the corner signal, so drivers must perform the intersection turn sequence rather than a straight single‐turn entry. The surrounding corridor is a dense, high‐traffic commercial area, which can add delay and competing turning movements at peak times. These factors yield a functional but not seamless entrance and exit configuration."

The single curb cut is highly visible to motorists, but a continuous raised median in front of the site blocks left-turn movements into and out of the property.  Entrance & Exit Complexity: There is one dedicated driveway serving both entry and exit, so there is no shared drive confusion. However, because the median has no break at the curb cut, drivers approaching from the opposite travel direction must overshoot the site and make a U-turn at the next opening, adding time and complexity.  Surrounding Environment & Potential for Conflict: The car wash sits between a fire station on one side and a Shell/Whataburger complex on the other. Traffic queuing into the gas station and fast-food drive-thru can occasionally back up toward the U-turn location, further delaying drivers.  Overall, while the driveway is clear, dedicated, and visible, the inability to make left turns directly and the reliance on a nearby U-turn point on a high-speed highway result in moderate accessibility."

The west entrance ties into the adjacent Subway lot, creating a shared drive scenario with potential for conflict or confusion. Surrounding high-volume commercial uses and the arterial’s traffic speeds further complicate left-turn access and can cause delays during peak hours. While direct right-in/right-out access is simple and highly visible, the median restrictions and shared driveway lower overall ease of entry and exit to a moderate level."

There is no direct curb cut from W Marcy Dr, and the highway median limits left-turn opportunities for westbound traffic. The entrance is obscured by adjacent residential lots, has minimal visibility or signage from the main road, and shares its approach with private home drives. These factors—indirect routing, hidden driveway, potential confusion with house entrances, and a median barrier—combine to produce consistently poor ingress and egress."

Instead it has a single, dedicated curb cut onto Old Pike St, a lower-volume side street one block south of the Morganza/Weavertown signal. Vehicles approaching on Morganza must first turn south onto Weavertown then immediately turn again onto Old Pike to reach the site; likewise to return to Morganza, a two-turn maneuver is required. Left turns from eastbound Morganza are prevented by a median, forcing drivers to detour through the signalized Morganza/Weavertown corner. The Old Pike entrance is clearly defined and free of shared conflicts at the curb cut, but that unsignalized side-street T‐intersection can back up under peak traffic and the car-wash signage is not visible until after leaving the arterial. Surrounded by a dense commercial node (coffee shops, fast food, pharmacy), cross‐traffic volumes at the nearby intersections further delays turning movements. Taken together—single‐point access off a secondary street, required two‐turn approach from the arterial, and potential queuing at side-street T‐intersection—the site earns a ‘moderate accessibility’ rating under the rubric (score 6)."

There is no raised median to block access. The only minor downside is that the asphalt lot is shared with an adjoining restaurant—two curb cuts sit within a short distance of one another—which can lead to slight driver confusion and turning conflicts during peak periods. Overall, entry and exit are direct and well defined, meriting a score of 8 for good accessibility."

Visibility of the entry off E 8th is good, but turning left across two moving lanes – especially under peak traffic – introduces moderate delay and risk.  The exit, however, does not return to E 8th Avenue directly: customers must follow the one-way wash exit northward onto William Marks Drive, then navigate around to rejoin the main road, adding indirect routing.  The site is in a busy commercial corridor so side-street traffic and curb cuts nearby can also slow inbound and outbound movements.  Taken together, the direct but potentially difficult turn-in and the indirect exit path yield a moderate overall accessibility score."

In addition, there is a separate, very visible driveway on N 25th St. that provides an alternate entry/exit.  Both curb cuts are dedicated to the car wash (there is no confusing, shared mall driveway), and the openings are obvious at typical vehicle speed on the main road.  Surrounding uses are all commercial/industrial, so while 422 can be busy at peak times, there are no closely abutting drive-thrus or high-intensity retail entrances immediately next to the car wash that would force customers into merge conflicts or stacking on the street.  In short, access is straightforward and intuitive from both directions on the main road (thanks to the median break) and from the side street, so only minor peak-hour left-turn waits keep us from a near-perfect score."

A driver on US-95 must turn onto the cross street and then almost immediately into the site, so access is straightforward but indirect. The corner location and signal make the driveway reasonably visible once you’re stopped at the light, but it could be missed by someone unfamiliar with the property.

Entrance & Exit Complexity: There is a single, well-defined curb cut serving the entire gas-and-car wash site, so there’s no confusing shared lot with multiple businesses. Physical barriers such as the highway median do not block the site entrance since all movements occur via the side street, though southbound US-95 travelers must execute a right then left in quick succession and northbound traffic a left then right. All turns are controlled by a signal, mitigating safety concerns but still requiring two maneuvers from the main road.

Surrounding Environment & Potential for Conflict: The immediate surroundings are a mix of empty desert to the west and a busy casino/resort entrance a few hundred feet to the south. While the driveway itself is free of adjacent cross-traffic, overall intersection delays can be pronounced during peak casino hours. Heavy turning movements off and onto US-95 can back up the side street, adding to the inconvenience for some customers.

Overall, the site is fully functional and clearly defined but hampered by indirect access from the primary highway and potential congestion at the signalized corner, placing it squarely in the moderate accessibility range."

Customers must exit US-17 at the signalized cross street (Cottonvale Road), then navigate a shared two-way frontage road serving multiple auto businesses (Express Oil Change, Goodyear, the credit union, etc.). The primary road is a high-speed arterial with a median preventing direct left-turn ingress or egress. The facility’s single driveway is shared among adjacent tenants, reducing clarity and increasing potential conflicts during busy periods. Overall, access is functional via a simple turn off the frontage road, but the lack of a dedicated entry on the highway itself, the shared drive, and required use of secondary roads make it only moderately accessible."

The car wash has its own clearly defined driveway on the north side of the road, so visual visibility and signage are good for right‐turn movements. However, the continuous median east of the signalized intersection immediately to the west prevents direct left‐in or left‐out access. Customers approaching from the east must pass the driveway, perform a U-turn at the intersection, then circle back for a right-in, and westbound drivers are forced into right-out maneuvers only. Surrounding uses (Wawa, Taco Bell, CVS, Walgreens, etc.) generate high cross traffic and frequent turning activity at the adjacent intersection, adding delay and complexity. These factors keep access functional but with significant inconvenience for one-direction customers, meriting a score of 5 (Moderate Accessibility)."

From the northbound direction it’s a very simple right-turn off Senoia Road onto Peachtree Landing, then an immediate left into the site’s dedicated driveway, which is highly visible at the intersection. From the southbound direction, however, there is no direct median opening or left-turn bay to the car wash driveway; a motorist must either make a nonstandard immediate turn off the intersection or proceed through, U-turn, and re-approach. The driveway itself is clearly defined and not shared with other users, but the high surrounding cross-traffic at the busy corner and the slight indirectness of one approach introduce modest complexity. Overall, access is entirely functional but carries enough directional and visibility drawbacks to land in the midrange of our scale."

The entrance and exit are therefore fairly visible and straightforward for one direction of travel, but forced U-turns for the opposite direction introduce a clear inconvenience. In addition, ingress and egress are shared with the adjacent gas station, creating potential for minor traffic conflicts, especially during peak hours. Overall, the site has functional, mostly direct access but is hampered by a restrictive median and shared curb cut, placing it in the moderate accessibility range."

This single, well-marked curb cut is exclusive to Big Dan’s and is highly visible to passing traffic. The median on US-441 does not block access because vehicles use the existing turn lanes at the intersection rather than a mid-block cut. Surrounding businesses generate typical commercial cross traffic, but there is no shared driveway or confusing circulation; the one-turn access is straightforward. The only minor drawback is that northbound drivers must either use the slip lane or make a left at the light and then a right into the site, which can require patience during peak flows. Overall, entrance and exit are clear, direct, and fully signaled, earning a ‘good’ accessibility rating of 8."

The driveway appears dedicated to the car wash (not shared), clearly marked at the roadside, and only a very short distance from the small side‐street intersection, which slightly elevates conflict potential but does not materially impede access. While the surrounding high-traffic retail corridor and the close proximity of adjacent driveways can create turn delays during peak periods, entry and exit remain straightforward and intuitive from both directions on 17A, meriting a good (7-8) accessibility rating. Given the minor conflict points but overall ease of access, an 8 is appropriate."

Both driveways are shared with adjacent businesses (a bottle shop to the west and oil-change service to the east), which can create turning conflicts during peak periods. While access is straightforward via right turns, the median restrictions and shared access points in a busy retail corridor impose significant drawbacks, yielding a moderate accessibility score."

Visibility from Broad Street is high, with no confusing side roads or circuitous in-lot routing required.  The only real drawback is the higher-speed traffic on a busy commercial corridor and a partner driveway directly across the street (Sherwin-Williams) which can occasionally lead to turning-movement conflicts during peak times.
